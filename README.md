## About

This project was built using vanilla javascript while incorporating three different weather API resources for more accurate information. Users can allow the application to read their current location (no data is saved about the user) so that they don't have to search manually. There's an option for converting from F to C and vise versa, and that option is then saved into the user's local storage so every time they visit the site, it'll be their last picked option! I designed everything from the logo to the cards itself, except the weather images (they're from the API).

## Technologies

Project is created with:

-  JavaScript
-  HTML/CSS
-  Figma
-  API/JSON


## Features

-  Search for cities using name or zip code
-  Displays relavent weather details in modern card styles
-  Convert C <-> F
-  Asks user for geolocation 
-  Incorporates multiple API's
-  Mobile friendly

## Challenges
Overall, it was tough to combine many APIs together to extract different information and displaying them. My earlier version didn't have the convert button and my parents requested it, so I had to come up with some ways to incorporate that functionality. Another challenge was making the day and time correct because it was my first time working with JavaScript Date object.


## Inspiration

My parents always ask their Siri about the weather and AQI every day so I decided to create a weather website for them!
